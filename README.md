# Plex Album Rating Engine

Automatically rate Plex albums based on individual track ratings using a fair, confidence-aware algorithm that accounts for unrated tracks and can exclude intros or skits.

## 🧠 Summary (TL;DR)

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Does the script re-evaluate album ratings? | ✅ Yes |

| Are ratings removed if coverage drops? | ✅ Yes |
| Can intros/skits be ignored? | ✅ Yes |
| Does it handle partially-rated albums? | ✅ Yes |
| Does it modify individual track ratings? | ❌ No (only album ratings) |
| Will it rate albums with zero rated tracks? | ❌ No (requires minimum coverage) |
| Can I test in dry-run mode before making changes? | ✅ Yes |
| Can it run automatically on a schedule? | ✅ Yes |
| Does it require Docker? | ✅ Yes |

## Features

- Fully **Dockerized** for Linux hosts.
- Safe-by-default **dry-run mode** before making changes.
- **Automatic album rating** based on track ratings using Bayesian shrinkage algorithm.
- **Coverage-aware** - respects minimum rated track threshold before rating albums.
- **Optional auto-unrating** - removes ratings from albums when tracks are manually unrated below threshold.
- **Track duration filtering** - excludes short tracks (intros/skits) from rating calculations.
- Can be scheduled nightly via **cron** for automated management.

## Requirements

- Plex Media Server (Plex Pass recommended)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Linux host (cron recommended for scheduling)
- Python 3.12+ (used inside container)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

### **Option A**: Latest development version (main branch)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobus3000/plex-album-auto-rater.git
cd plex-album-auto-rater
```

### **Option B**: Specific release version (stable)

```bash
git clone --branch v1.0.0 https://github.com/tobus3000/plex-album-auto-rater.git
cd plex-album-auto-rater
```

> Replace `v1.0.0` with your desired release tag. See [releases](https://github.com/tobus3000/plex-album-auto-rater/releases) for available versions.

1. Create a `.env` file based on the provided template:

```bash
# Required
PLEX_URL=http://plex:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN
PLEX_MUSIC_LIBRARY=Music

# Safety
DRY_RUN=true

# Algorithm tuning
NEUTRAL_RATING=3.0
CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT=4
MIN_COVERAGE=0.2
MIN_TRACK_DURATION=60

# Features
UNRATE_EMPTY_ALBUMS=false
```

> Tip: Keep `DRY_RUN=true` for your first run to preview actions without modifying Plex ratings.

1. Build the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Usage

### Manual run

```bash
docker-compose up plex-album-auto-rater
```

You should see log output listing albums that would be rated in Plex. The application logs all operations with timestamps and severity levels.

Once verified, disable dry-run mode:

```bash
# Disable dry-run
sed -i 's/DRY_RUN=true/DRY_RUN=false/' .env
docker-compose up plex-album-auto-rater
```

### Nightly automation with cron

1. Open root crontab:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

1. Add a nightly job (runs at 3:00 AM):

```cron
0 3 * * * cd /path-to-plex-album-auto-rater && docker-compose up plex-album-auto-rater
```

- Update the path `/path-to-plex-album-auto-rater` to your repository location.
- Logs are automatically managed by Docker.

### Viewing Logs

The application outputs logs to the Docker container's STDOUT, which Docker automatically captures and rotates.

**View logs in real-time:**

```bash
docker-compose logs -f plex-album-auto-rater
```

**View last 50 log lines:**

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail=50 plex-album-auto-rater
```

**Log rotation details:**

- Individual log files are limited to **10 MB**
- Docker keeps the **latest 3 rotated files** (~30 MB total)
- Logs are stored in Docker's data directory and automatically rotated

## Updating

To update to a new version:

### **Option A**: Update to latest development version (main branch)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### **Option B**: Update to specific release version (stable)

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout v1.0.0
```

> Replace `v1.0.0` with your desired release tag. See [releases](https://github.com/tobus3000/plex-album-auto-rater/releases) for available versions.

1. Rebuild the Docker image:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

1. Test with dry-run mode first:

```bash
DRY_RUN=true docker-compose up plex-album-auto-rater
```

1. Once verified, run with your configured settings:

```bash
docker-compose up plex-album-auto-rater
```

## ⚠️ Important Plex Notes

- Plex album ratings use 1–5 stars
- `track.userRating` and `album.userRating` both follow this scale
- Ratings are user-specific
- This script should run under the same Plex user that rates tracks

## Logging

The application uses Python's standard logging module with INFO level by default. All operations are logged with timestamps and severity levels:

- **INFO**: Configuration summary, album updates, completion statistics
- **WARNING**: Album/track retrieval failures (albums are skipped)
- **ERROR**: Critical failures (connection errors, calculation failures)
- **DEBUG**: Detailed operational information (track processing, skipped albums)

Logs can be captured and redirected as needed (e.g., to a file via cron or Docker logging drivers).

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PLEX_URL` | — | Plex server URL (e.g., `http://plex:32400`). **Required**. |
| `PLEX_TOKEN` | — | Plex authentication token. **Required**. |
| `PLEX_MUSIC_LIBRARY` | `Music` | Name of the music library to process. |
| `DRY_RUN` | `true` | Preview mode. Set to `false` to apply ratings to Plex. |
| `NEUTRAL_RATING` | `3.0` | Neutral prior rating for Bayesian calculation (1-10 scale). |
| `CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT` | `4` | Confidence constant for shrinkage (higher = more conservative). |
| `MIN_COVERAGE` | `0.2` | Minimum fraction of rated tracks required to rate album (0.0-1.0). |
| `MIN_TRACK_DURATION` | `60` | Minimum track duration in seconds (excludes short tracks). |
| `UNRATE_EMPTY_ALBUMS` | `false` | Automatically remove ratings from albums that no longer meet coverage threshold. |

### UNRATE_EMPTY_ALBUMS Feature

When enabled (`true`), this feature automatically removes ratings from albums that have fallen below the `MIN_COVERAGE` threshold. This is useful when you manually unrate tracks in Plex and want albums to be automatically unrated if they no longer have enough rated tracks.

**Example scenario:**

- Album has 10 tracks, 3 are rated (30% coverage) → Album is rated ✓
- You manually unrate 2 tracks in Plex
- Album now has 1 rated track (10% coverage) → Falls below MIN_COVERAGE (20%)
- With `UNRATE_EMPTY_ALBUMS=true`, album rating is automatically removed ✓

**Default is `false`** to prevent accidental removal of ratings. Enable only if this behavior is desired.

## Rating Algorithm

The rating algorithm is based on a Bayesian Shrinkage Rating system.

> Start with a neutral prior and let real ratings pull the album toward its true value as confidence increases.

### Features of this algorithm

- Assume unrated tracks are neutral (not bad, not amazing)
- Never rate an album if zero tracks are rated
- Avoid inflation from a single 5⭐ track
- Reward albums with consistently high ratings
- Penalize albums with many unrated tracks
- Converge naturally as more tracks are rated
- Stay in Plex’s 1–5 star model

### 🧮 Formula

Let:

- R̄ = average rating of rated tracks
- n = number of rated tracks
- N = total tracks on album
- C = neutral rating (recommend 3.0)
- k = confidence constant (recommend 3–5)

#### Bayesian album rating

```python
album_rating =
  ((n * R̄) + (k * C)) / (n + k)
```

#### Hard floor rule

Before applying coverage penalty, check if the album is consistently bad:

```python
if coverage >= 0.7 and avg_rating <= 1.3:
    return 1
```

This ensures albums with **70%+ coverage** and **average rating ≤ 1.3** get an immediate 1-star rating. This is useful because:

- Bayesian shrinkage normally pulls bad albums toward the neutral rating
- A hard floor prevents underrated bad albums from being smoothed out

**Example:** An album with 8/10 tracks rated at 1 star each would normally smooth toward 3.0 (neutral). The hard floor prevents this and keeps it at 1 star for easy cleanup.

Then apply coverage penalty:

```python
coverage = n / N
final_rating = album_rating * coverage + C * (1 - coverage)
```

Final rating is rounded up to nearest whole star for Plex:

```python
plex_rating = ceil(final_rating)
```
